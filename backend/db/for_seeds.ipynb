Award-Winning Richard Scarry\\'s  I am a Bunny Boardbook for aged 1-5 $10.90 (usual $15) Available at all My Greatest Child bookstores In the spring, Nicholas picks flowers and chases butterflies, and in the summer, watches the frogs in the pond. In the autumn, he sees the animals preparing for the winter. When winter comes, Nicholas watches the snow falling from the sky, then curls up in his hollow tree and dreams about spring. In print for well over 50 years, this beautifully illustrated, gentle story has been a favorite Golden Book for generations. \"This is one of those books that I\\'m more than happy to read again and again when my kiddo asks me to. I remember the sweet illustrations from when I was little and they are no less whimsical and beautiful to me now than they were to me when I was young.\" - Sam Pedersen \"This is a wonderful book with beautiful illustrations. On each page it describes what the bunny does each season in short sentences. This is one of my 18 month old sons favorite books and one of my favorite books to read to him. The illustrations are so realistic looking. He recognizes all of the animals, trees, flowers, etc. for what they are which I really love. He can name so many things in this book. We read it almost every day. I’m looking for similar books to this one because it’s been such a big hit. Highly recommend for any child ages 0-5.\" - Erica B.',\n",
