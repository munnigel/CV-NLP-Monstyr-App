Science can be a fun and interesting subject to learn especially since it covers a wide range of topics. However, with so many concepts to explore, students get confused about the facts while revising for their exams. For example, is a spider an insect? How do you explain the difference between a mammal and a fish? Misconceptions can cost students unnecessary loss of marks. This is why it's important to get things straightened out as early as possible. Join us for our next live webinar happening on 16 Feb at 8PM to learn how you can help your child identify and correct common Science misconceptions. Limited slots available!
