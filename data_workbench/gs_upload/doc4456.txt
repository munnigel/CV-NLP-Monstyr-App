The wait is over! White Space Art Asia is proud to announce our first solo show for the year, 'Eyes Wide Open' with Indonesian artist Mutiara Riswari. With several group exhibitions and a solo exhibition in Jakarta under Riswari's belt, the UOB 'Painting of the Year' finalist presents a lauded, audacious oeuvre that speaks of her artistry and command of her craft. From 24 February to 25 March 2022, the Yogyakarta-based artist will have her inaugural show in Singapore with White Space Art Asia. A combination of evocative brushwork and striking colours, 'Eyes Wide Open' is an intimate exploration into the psychology of colour and reveals a new language of emotions written in colour. In Riswari's universe, colours are the mirrors of reality, and its through colours that our eyes become wide open.
