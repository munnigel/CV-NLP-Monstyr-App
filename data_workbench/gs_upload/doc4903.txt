The menu for this week is now available with ala carte main courses starting from $4.50 (& up). Our menu items are still available ready to eat & chilled. We remain OPEN for dine in; but can only accommodate group sizes of up to 5 fully vaccinated individuals. For takeaways - we recommend you call in advance with your order to reduce your waiting time. Delivery service is available @ $15 per trip. To guarantee delivery by your preferred time, we recommend you order one day in advance so that we can secure you your preferred delivery time slot. Of course if you prefer, you are free to self-collect or arrange your own delivery (pick-up) service (eg. through Grab). In the meantime, please stay safe & take care! #SugeeCake #EurasianPie #ShepherdsPie #CurryDebal #CurryDevil #ChickenBuahKeluak #BeefSmore #PorkBuahKeras #TauYewBak #SaltFishPickle #VegetableAchar #Takeaway #SugeeCakeIcing
