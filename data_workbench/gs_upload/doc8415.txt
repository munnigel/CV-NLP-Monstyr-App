Great news! Our Benita Adjustable Bed now comes with the option to add a headboard. It's now double the comfort for you - whether you choose to incline the backrest of the adjustable bed, or prop yourself to More sit up and lean against the headboard when the bed is flat. We love how the addition of the upholstered headboard fills up any empty wall space and instantly creates a cosier ambience. The next best thing about having just the headboard with Benita Bed is that there is room for easy cleaning, even with a robot vacuum cleaner! Psst... the Benita Adjustable Bed Frame + Headboard is exclusively available in store. Drop us a visit at our showroom to experience this adjustable bed. Showroom More
