katfoodadventure Affordable Italian food in Singapore! Milan Doria poached egg ($5.90) - the PERFECT yolk! Love that the poached egg was superb-ly runny! This dish is literally just carbs with cream sauce, tomato sauce & an egg but surprisingly satisfying? Buffalo Mozzarella Cheese ($3.90) - I loved this! it's not as creamy nor smooth like burrata but I'm actually surprised that I could find something like this in @saizeriyasg Cheese was soft and being mozzarella, it doesn't have that intense cheese flavor so it's perfect for those ppl who dislike intense cheese taste #sgeat #sgigfood #sgfoodlover #sgfoodbloggers #sgigfoodie #sgfoodtrend #sgfoodies #sgfoodgram #sgfoodblogger #sgfood #sgfoodstagram #sgrestaurant #singaporefood #singaporefoodies #singaporefoodie #singaporeeats #singaporelife #singaporeinsiders #singaporeinsta #eatsg #exploresingaporeeats #whati8today #instafoodsg #pastanight #pastapasta #pastatime #pastaaddict #italianfoodphotography #italianfoodblogger #italianfoodbloggers
