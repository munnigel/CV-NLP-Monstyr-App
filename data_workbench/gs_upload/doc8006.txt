Mark your calendars for the return of Art Encounters' seventh edition at the upcoming Singapore Art Week 2022! We'll be travelling to the Marina Bay Sands Event Plaza from 8 January to 6 February 2022, More featuring an installation of kinetic sculptures by local artist Gerald Leow under the theme of "Perpetual Motion". Activate a series of towering mirrored columns designed to turn by hand or in the wind, and view drawings and maquettes by Leow that shed light onto his continual drive to experiment. That's not all - you can also meet the artist himself on weekends through a series of demonstrations, and make your own pinwheel inspired by the show.
