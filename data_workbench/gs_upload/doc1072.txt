bringing back the easter bunny's favorite jussstttt for easter our carrot cake will be available in stores from april 1-17. we did a lil digging and found that the modern carrot cake is a take on medieval More carrot puddings enjoyed by people in europe. as sugar was hard to source and expensive to procure, people looked to carrots as a sweet alternative. we've hand grated carrots to produce these small batch bakes! our carrot cake is topped off with cream cheese, assorted nuts, and rose petals.
