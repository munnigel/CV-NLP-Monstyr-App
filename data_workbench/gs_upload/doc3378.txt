NEW art print 'Legacy Orchid' This Singapore Orchid design infused with Peranakan tiles is emblematic of Singapore's unique legacy of multiculturalism, harmony and creativity. This legacy found its root in Singapore's strategic geography, which has for centuries been a welcome to people from all over the world. Cultural essence of all types evolved over time into modern, colourful forms, but diversity has been embraced and celebrated since the beginning and for aeons. Hand-crafted legacy tiles blended within orchids' natural, timeless elegance is a most apt expression of Singapore's fortuitous journey to modernity. #giftideas #festiveseason #onlewo
