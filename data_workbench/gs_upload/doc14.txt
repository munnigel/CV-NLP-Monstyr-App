We enjoyed seeing you take #instaworthy shots against Putra's fantastical forest More of reimagined cave drawings, and getting creative with your own colourful strokes and doodles in our colouring room Thank you Rizman Putra and crew for enlivening our space and engaging our visitors with a truly unique art experience! But wait, it isn't goodbye just yet Stay tuned for updates on an exciting new project that repurposes the collectively created artworks at IMMEMORIAL!
