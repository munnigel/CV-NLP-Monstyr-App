Loud colours and shiny accessories decorate this Jordan Why Not.5 "Nebula". On the upper, we have a nice mix of contrasting colours like blue and orange on places like the tongue and eyelets. The peach and beige act as the prime base colours to help the sharper tones really take over the multilayer fuze materials. Additional details include lace accessories that add a little bling for that extra style points on court. ---------------------------------------------- LIMITEDEDT.COM | Available now ---------------------------------------------- Available INSTORES 11AM LE Ball Park @ 313 Somerset LE Hall Of Fame @ Vivo City LE Hall Of Fame @ Queensway Members may call in to reserve, one pair per member in their own sizing only. #LimitedEdtSG #LEbball #Nike #Jordan #nikebasketball
