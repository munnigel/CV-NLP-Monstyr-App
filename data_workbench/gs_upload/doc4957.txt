[RESTOCK] Fountain Pen Ink by @noodlersink - "Noodler's Ink" has the lowest cost per volume in stores that carry it, and it's 100% made in the USA from cap to glass to ink. The ink with the catfish on the label symbolizes a southern sport that attempts to equalize the struggle between man and animal in the quest for a sense of fair play - and thus a fair price. - Get it now at our retail or web store! - #OverjoyedXYZ #IAmOverjoyed #AnotherReasonToBeOverjoyed #Noodlers #Ink #Fountain #Pen #Writing #Journaling #FineWriting #SGArtStore #TheCathay
