HAPPY BULLET JOURNAL DAY! Journaling is more than just writing on paper- it's an expression of your dreams, an extension of your thoughts and a way for you to document your most precious of memories. While More boosting your creativity and purpose, it also allows you to relax, providing an aid to those who suffer from stress and anxiety. To celebrate Bullet Journal Day, we'll be posting a few short stories about how journaling has impacted these journals and we'll be starting with one of our instructors, Shirley (@enchantedbyscraps)! To sweeten the celebrations, we'll also be giving away 4 Leuchtturm1917 A5 Softcover Dotted Notebooks to 4 different winners. Look out for details very soon!
