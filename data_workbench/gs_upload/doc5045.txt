Repost @hometrulee Do you usually sleep with the AC switched on? We don't because the mister would have sinus issues in the morning if we do. Thus, having fans in the bedroom is a must for us. The latest EuropAce EJF7930V DC Jet Turbine Fan has been a great addition to our home. Its woodgrain pattern on its frame fits our Scandinavian/Japandi home perfectly. Double tap if you agree! The best thing is that they are having a GIVEAWAY this Feb (swipe to find out more)! Here's what we like about it: : The sage green adds a pop of colour to our home while complementing our Japandi theme with its wooden frame. I never thought this colour would look so good in our home. : Our first fan with 4 way oscillation. We love how it can move left, right, up and down. : The aromatherapy feature! The cap at the front can be removed to add essential/aroma oil. It has a felt pad for you to drip the oil on and they even provided additional felt pads. We have been using this feature and we love it so much. : Japanese DC motor is designed to be silent and can provide energy savings of up to 50% as compared to other air circulators. We also love how it has several speed modes for us to choose. : We love the portability of this fan. We can place it anywhere - our bedside table, dining table, work desk and even in the kitchen. Swipe to see where we have used it so far! Thank you @europacesingapore We love this so much! Do follow them to get updated about their giveaway that's happening soon! Curious though, anyone doesn't sleep with air conditioning too? #sp #EuropAce #EuropAceSingapore #EuropAceSG #SingaporeBrand #europacefan #aircirculator #aromatherapy #aromatherapysg
