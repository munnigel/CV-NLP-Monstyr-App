Ever wondered how your smile could look like with straightened teeth? Try Self Ligating Braces - similar to traditional braces which use stainless steel brackets that are fixed on the surface of the teeth but without the use of elastic bands. A specialised metal clip holds the arch-wire in place without clamping it tightly. Swipe to find out more about the benefits of self-ligating braces VS traditional braces! We offer self-ligating ceramic braces where transparent brackets are used, making braces less noticeable if it's a concern for you.
