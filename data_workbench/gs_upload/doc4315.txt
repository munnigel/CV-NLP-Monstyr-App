OATSIDE Mocha with Chocolate Oat Milk It's not a common sight - chocolate oat milk that is. Therefore, when we learned that Oatside had this variant, we had to include it as part of our limited-time special! Using only real cacao (twice the amount of cacao than most), no added flavours and with less sugar (sugar content is 40% to 60% lower than most and utilizing raw palm nectar instead of refined cane sugar), this pour brings out complex dark chocolate notes with a creamy mouthfeel. It's a delicious drink for all you lovers out there. Don't just take our word for it, come down to any Baker & Cook store to experience this indulgent concoction before 6 March! - #bakerandcooksg #oatside
