. - . Izumo-no-kuni is an area known for its production of high quality "washi" (Japanese paper). The barrel is hand-made from Tagayasan (Bombay Blackwood), a variety More of rosewood. . Unlike the other pens in the Izumo range, the Matte Tagayasan range doesn't have an Urushi lacquer coating. Instead, the barrel receives a delicately-applied wax coating which brings out the beautiful grain of the wood. . - : $ . ? ! ! #AestheticBay #EngagingYourSoul #Platinum #Izumo #Tagayasan #Matte #Fountain #Pen #Gift #Collectible #IONOrchard #Singapore
