The global Slow Art movement believes in the power of slowing down. It encourages people to savour art in a conscious manner, and to create a deep and mindful experience. Join us on 2 April as National Gallery More Singapore celebrates Slow Art Day for the second year in a row. This year, we have two unique experiences to offer. You can either come down to the Gallery to experience the newly launched Slow Art Guide, or log on for a Zoom session of Slow Art Online from the comfort of your own home! On this special day, all programmes are free. Slots are limited so sign up now!
