[Upcoming Exhibition at HEARTH ] Take in a multi-sensorial showcase that uses olfaction and light to explore how one's energies can influence space! Responding to and evolving with visitor engagement, "Scent" (2022) by Victoria Hertel uses Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) sensors to convert scent molecules into data that is subsequently transformed into electrical light waves via a visualisation software. With each basic aromatic note corresponding to a different hue of light, anticipate an ever-changing wash of colours that correlates to the unique scent profile of visitors in the space. Opening this Friday at HEARTH, "Scent" invites you to bridge gaps between the body, materiality and space!
