We're Been Featured! EATBOOK.SG Review on Kucina Italian's Signature Tiramisu: "11 Best Tiramisu In Singapore To Satisfy Your Cravings" Singapore's pioneering halal Italian restaurant, Kucina, is famed for their house-made fresh pasta dishes, but they also make a fluffy, lightweight tiramisu that's great to close off a meal. Priced at $10.90++, their version is a slice of airy mascarpone cream, layered with espresso-bittered ladyfingers, all topped with cocoa dust and chocolate shavings. Eatbook is Singapore's leading Food Review Website that offers honest reviews and recommendations on Singapore food! More Info About Tiramisu: Tiramisu is the quintessential Italian dolci (dessert). I can think of few better ways to close off a decadent, carb- and cheese-loaded Italian meal than with this airy medley of booze, coffee, and cream. What's even better is that I don't have to travel to Italy to get my fix of this dessert, given the lengthy list of eateries and cafes in Singapore that do a mean rendition.
