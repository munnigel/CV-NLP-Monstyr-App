Enjoy authentic Italian pasta and pasta sauce at M&S! All our dried pasta is made in the Italian Alps by the Felicetti family, who have been making pasta for four generations. They use only clear spring water to make the pasta, and pure mountain air to dry it, which allows for the perfect al dente texture.
