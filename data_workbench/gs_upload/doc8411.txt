TAMRON 18-300mm F3.5-6.3 Di III-A VC VXD | All-in-one zoom, engineered specifically for APS-C-format FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras, provides a 27-450mm equivalent focal length range. Vibration More Compensation uses a free-floating element, controlled through two gyroscopic sensors to measure the horizontal and vertical vibrations and compensate accordingly, eliminating camera shake. Two VXD (Voice-coil eXtreme-torque Drive) linear motors deliver impressively quiet, quick, and precise focusing performance to suit both stills and video applications. A weather-sealed construction benefits this lens' use in inclement conditions.
