Founded in Kyoto, Japan in 1790, Fukujuen is a traditional and premium tea brand in Japan. With the use of information technology and research on the current lifestyle with tea, they create numerous new tea More products to meet the growing demand. To celebrate its 20th Anniversary in Singapore at Takashimaya, it is our honour to be using Fukujuen's matcha on our regular Cake Basic (Petit Four Sec & Matcha Terrine), Cooking (Yatai Wonderland ~Learn Healthy Version of Street Food) and Wagashi (Ukishima) lessons in August. We will also be incorporating its matcha product with our upcoming 1 Day Lesson! If you are a matcha lover and would love to have your hands on Fukujuen's products, good news! More
