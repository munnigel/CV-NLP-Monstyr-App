When it comes to die-hard beauty rules, using sunscreen regularly is non-negotiable. And yet, despite its importance in any healthy skincare routine, finding an SPF-packed product that doesn't feel oily or More leave behind a white cast can be a challenge, especially if your skin is on the oily side or you have darker skin. Thankfully, for the last couple of years, numerous brands have been listening to consumers' frustrations and have tweaked some of their old formulas and launched entirely new iterations too. Case In Point: Nivea UV Super Water Gel, a clear, primer-like sunscreen with an oil-free, completely invisible, scentless, and lightweight formula.
