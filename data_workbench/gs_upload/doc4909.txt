[REPOST @azzahfariha ] Recently I've tried the halal Suki-Suki Thai Hotpot with my entire family, conveniently located at Toa Payoh Safra (family-friendly location and parking is ample, so no worries!) and we love it! I was in awe of the variety of soups they offer, even child-friendly, non-spicy soups like Chicken Broth! I highly recommend the Homemade Fish Paste, Prawn Paste and Chicken Meatballs! Plus, I love that they are a @madeforfamiliessg partner! All families can enjoy a discounted Kid's Buffet Menu at $13.90++ on weekdays! Definitely heading there for our meal again Check out more family-friendly deals like this one at https://bit.ly/madeforfamilies @sukisukithai.sg #SukiSukiThaiHotpot #MadeForFamilies
