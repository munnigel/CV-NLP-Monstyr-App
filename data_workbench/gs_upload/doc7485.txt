The term BRED was created by sneakerheads' love for the OG Jordan 1 colourway. A play of the words Black and Red, this Air Jordan 1 Mid GS pays homage to this slang that has been with sneaker culture since its inception. The make-up of this Jordan 1 Mid mostly follows the Jordan 1 blocking of the black and red leather panels. The standout feature of this sneaker is the words plastered all over the respective black and red panels in a clear glossy finish. An equation of "Black + Red = BRED" can be seen on the medial side of the white midsole, showing others outside the sneaker world how the term "BRED" was coined. ---------------------------------------------- INSTORES | Available now ---------------------------------------------- Available now at the following LE Stores, one pair per customer only, no size limitations for public: LE Ball Park @ 313 Somerset [MEMBERS ONLY] LE Hall Of Fame @ Vivo City [MEMBERS ONLY] Public: LE Underground @ Marina Bay Sands LE Ball Park @ Wisma LE Hall Of Fame @ Queensway Members may WALK in with their PHYSICAL member cards to the above member-allocated stores to purchase , one pair per member IN OWN SIZE ONLY.
