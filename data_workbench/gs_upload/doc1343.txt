NEW IN THE SHOP! We're big fans of HOKA's cushiony, lightweight Clifton 8 trainer, and we've just gotten it in a new colour Blue Coral/Butterfly for men. Featuring a streamlined silhouette and engineered mesh upper, the Clifton 8 delivers the perfect combination of soft and light. Outfitted with a plush collar that eases Achilles pressure, the Clifton 8 is equipped with an intuitive pull tab at the heel for easy on-and-off. Find your sweet spot in the Clifton 8.
