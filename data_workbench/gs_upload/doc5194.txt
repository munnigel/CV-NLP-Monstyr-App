NEW EXHIBITION Art, science and ethics collide in Patricia Piccinini: We Are Connected. Opening 5th August 2022, ArtScience Museum presents one of our most evocative exhibitions to date as we draw visitors into a strange and wonderous reality where animal-human hybrids exist. Come discover the beautifully bizarre hybrid creatures of Patricia Piccinini's sculptural universe. Staged in collaboration with the Institute for Culture Exchange, Germany, Patricia Piccinini: We are Connected brings together more than 40 artworks, making this Piccinini's first major solo showcase in Southeast Asia. One of the world's leading contemporary artists, Piccinini's work explores the evolving relationship between humans and nature, embracing the possibilities of ever-changing human bodies and lifeforms that straddle the artificial and natural. Patricia Piccinini: We Are Connected will run from 5 August 2022 to 29 January 2023.
