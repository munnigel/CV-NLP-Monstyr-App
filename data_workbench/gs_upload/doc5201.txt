Yaaaaayyyyy!!! New shipment from Japan. The olive (Olea europaea) is the fruit of the olive tree. It is an important food crop in countries around the Mediterranean Sea, and places with a Mediterranean More climate. In Roman literature, the olive branch is used as a symbol of peace: "extending the olive branch". In Christianity, too, it is seen as a symbol of peace, because according to the Bible, a dove brought an olive branch to Noah to show that the flood was over. Many writers and illustrators use olive branches around text to give it greater artistic credit (a similar effect is achieved with wheat).
