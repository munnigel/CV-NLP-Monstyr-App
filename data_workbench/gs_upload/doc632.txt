SEIKO PROSPEX 1970 Diver's Modern Re-interpretation Save the Ocean Special Edition Seiko introduces into the Prospex collection modern re-interpretations of diver's watches from the 1970's that draw their design inspiration from the glaciers that these pioneers saw and that shape the landscapes and seascapes of the Arctic and Antarctic. The white dial of SPB301J1, capturing the glacial seascape of the Artic is encased in the same distinctive shaped case as the 1970 classic which proved its strength and endurance when worn by the Japanese adventurer Naomi Uemura.
