The Rose Petal Sun Moon Shirt is made in 100% Rose Petal Fibre that has been converted into fabric from floral waste. As with most of our menswear, this is a unisex design! The fabric has a More light, flowing and slightly silky texture. The back of the shirt features an artisan hand-embroidered Sun and Moon kissing, symbolizing the harmony of dark and light or yin and yang.
