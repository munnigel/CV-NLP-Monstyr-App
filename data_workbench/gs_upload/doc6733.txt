#TrekProcaliber Great Value and Superior Ride Quality. Noone knows how a hardtail can truly ride until they ride on the Trek Procaliber. Forget everything you know about a 'conventional' HT. The Procaliber kicks it's competitors out of the park - $4,199 for a race ready, trail smashing hardtail. Fast Rolling 29" Wheels, Isospeed to tame the trails and a build kit that will bring you places! Have we mentioned the oil slick bits?
