With every new year comes a clean slate. Let's start the new year by going greener this year! Together with @pigeonsingapore, we're stepping closer to a sustainable culture by recycling your used nursing bottles. Exclusively @ motherswork, Great World from now till 31 Jan only! Drop off your preloved milk bottles or skincare plastic containers and enjoy discount on selected bottles and the new Natural Botanical Baby Skincare range. #mothersworksg #pigeonsingapore #GoGreenwithPigeon #loveourbabiesloveourplanet
