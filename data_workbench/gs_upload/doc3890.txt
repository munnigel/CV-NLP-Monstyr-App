[New Vegan Outlet - Hvala Craig] Many of you have been telling us how much you miss the vegan waffles and gelato at our Keong Saik outlet when we changed it to the @muse_initiative concept. So we decided More to open a new outlet just a stone's throw away at Craig Road to satisfy those cravings of yours! And to make things even better, this will be the first hvala outlet to feature a 100% vegan menu. Our pastry team has been working hard the past few months to present a range of vegan cakes and tarts, including the crowd favourite matcha mont blanc and mont noir! The address is 40 Craig Road and the operating hours for now are 12 to 9.30pm (closed on Tuesdays). We hope to see you soon! #vegan #hvala #hvalasg #art #craft #tea#thirdwavetea # #ichigoichie #matcha #hojicha #onetimeonemeeting #sharedmomentintime #teaforlife #pottery #japanesetea #thirdwavetea #dessert #waffles #gelato
