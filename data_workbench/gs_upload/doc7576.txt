This is Kang Jaeyang, a pianist from Korea and he plays the most beautiful and romantic ballads - from Moon River to (Disney's) I See The Light - all from memory. His rendition of Yiruma's Kiss The Rain is one More of my favourites. And he'll be at Orange & Teal tomorrow evening (30 Mar) from 6pm onwards. If you're looking for an enchanting evening with great food and serenaded by lovely music, do come by. What's more, Wed nites are our Wine Nites - 20% off our wines.
