This National Day, we pay tribute to our frontline heroes in our battle against COVID-19 through a new set of stamps. The Covid-19 series II - A Tribute to Frontline Heroes - honors everyday heroes who continue More to fight hard against the unseen enemy in their respective jobs. Featuring frontline heroes like healthcare workers, transport workers, hawkers, cleaners and educators, we are proud to also have our Postmen and Postal Ambassadors represented captured in this set of stamps. On 6 August 2021, interested collectors can purchase these stamps from any Post Offices, Philatelic Stores, or on our online shop at https://shop.singpost.com/
