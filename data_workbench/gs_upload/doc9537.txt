- - . Nakaya Piccolo Long Cigar Maki-e Butterfly Kuro-Tamenuri Fountain Pen utilizes the compact shape of the Piccolo model to show off the More rich, black-red finish. The butterfly symbolises the spiritual process of transformation, hope and rebirth. The intricate technique of Maki-e further highlights the ephemeral beauty of the butterflies. . This Nakaya fountain pen is made of hand-turned ebonite hard rubber that is meticulously coated with Urushi, a material made from the sap of a Japanese lacquer tree. . Because this is a handmade writing instrument, colors will vary slightly from pen to pen - no two will ever be exactly alike. . ! . ? ! http://ow.ly/mrmY50GAX7G , ! #AestheticBay #EngagingYourSoul #Nakaya #Piccolo #Long #Cigar #Maki-e #BUtterfly #Kuro #Tamenuri #Fountain #Pen #Gift #Collectible #IONOrchard #Singapore
