#TrekDomaneGravel One Bike for everything. So you already have your carbon road bike for the weekend bunch rides but always been yearning for a bike that you can take to the green corridor or More hit up pandan reservoir gravel paths? or coffee's at the CBD on weekdays followed by a cheeky spin around town? No compromise on ride quality - enter the Trek Domane AL 5 and at Treknology3, you can upgrade to gravel tires to give the bike that much more versatility and who can argue about the look? It just looks like a fun bike to ride! At $2,999 - it's an amazing package.
