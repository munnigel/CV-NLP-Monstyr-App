In celebration of Takashimaya's 28TH anniversary, BONIA has collaborated with The Little Arts Academy (LAA) and 10 Square Youth to launch special edition bags and small leather goods for charitable purposes. The BONIA Sophia Bag and small items feature 58 Orchid-inspired designs, all uniquely hand-drawn by young talents from the two centres. To financially support disadvantaged children and youths through the arts, 10% of the proceeds will be donated to The Business Times Budding Artists Fund (BT BAF). Handbags start from $280. Small leather goods start from $80. In the spirit of loving and giving, let's do our part to make our world a more beautiful place for everyone! Happening from now to Wed 3 Nov 2021 at Bonia, Ladies' Handbags, Level 2. #takashimaya
