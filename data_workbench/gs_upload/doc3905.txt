RUNNING, FROM POLE TO POLE! Many of us are planning (or have already planned) race-related travel, some of which involves either going far, going up and down, or both! If you think you may need poles to support you in your upcoming Epic Adventure(s), come in to the shop to talk to us. If you're a trekking pole newbie, we can show you how they work, and if you're a grizzled veteran in need of a new pair of poles, we'd love to show you what we've got. One of our favourite pole brands is ZENONE, who offer a few options from aluminium to carbon (BTW, ZENONE makes the lightest carbon pole in the world; 99g for the 100cm poles), including Carbon Colour and Carbon-Aluminium. ZENONE Ultra-Light Trekking Poles are strong, durable four-section folding poles, with an 18-month quality guarantee. Prices range from $159 (aluminium) to $279 (coloured carbon). We've got all sizes in stock so you can get the perfect fit. Check 'em out online at www.rdrc.sg/collections/zenone-poles-1 or in the shop! And don't forget we have an in-store running trail on which you can test new gear! #reddotrunningcompany #reddotrunningco #rdrcsg #zenonepoles
