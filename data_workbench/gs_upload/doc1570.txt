NEW IN THE SHOP! Allez means go in French. In developing the ALZCap and ALZCap SC, Ciele took all the things you love about the Ciele GOCap, increased the COOLwick mesh coverage for more breathability and More reduced the size for a lower profile, more fitted look. The ALZCap SC incorporates Ciele's SOFTcurve, small brim that brings pre-curved performance and protection to the party while not sacrificing comfort on those long runs. Ciele caps are lightweight, reflective, machine washable, packable and very, very stylish. Also, built using REPREVE, the world's number one brand of recycled performance fibre, and backed by Ciele's million miles guarantee. Check out the ALZCap SC - Athletic Small in the Hibiscus and Ventura styles, the ALZCap SC - Standard Stripes in the Akalaka and Edwards styles, and the ALZCap SC Night Run - Gridfront Century Large in the Red Rocks and Trooper styles.
