MJ birthday celebrations continue as we bring you yet another Jordan launch. Nearly a decade from its last release, the Air Jordan 12 "Playoffs" makes a red-carpet return in 2022. This is one retro you don't want to miss this All-Star weekend. Originally released back in the 1997 All-Star Game, the 2022 retro has a darker-toned finish which is true to its original counterpart. The "Playoffs" colourway features that signature black tumbled leather with silver lace tabs. The toe of the sneaker is split with white leather panels into the medial and lateral sides for that signature design from the Jordan 12. ---------------------------------------------- LIMITEDEDT.COM | PS & TD | Available now ---------------------------------------------- Available INSTORES 11am LE Ball Park @ 313 Somerset LE Hall Of Fame @ Vivo City LE Hall Of Fame @ Queensway Members may call in to reserve, one pair per member in their own sizing only. #LimitedEdtSG #LEbball #Nike #Jordan #allstarweekend2022
