Our Teochew Bak Changs are making a comeback for Dragon Boat Festival ()! Crafted in collaboration with Thye Moh Chan, our handmade glutinous rice dumplings come in two delightful flavours - Double Delight and Salted Egg, both wrapped in fragrant bamboo leaves. Our Teochew Double Delight Bak Chang () offers the best of both worlds sweet and savoury flavours. Dig into chunks of braised pork belly, shiitake mushrooms, harmonised with a mix of Thye Moh Chan's famous sweet tau sar and chestnut. For a taste of nostalgia, our Teochew Salted Egg Bak Chang () hits the spot. Each dumpling is filled to the brim with pork belly, dried shrimp, chestnut and a fresh salted egg. Savour these treats with your family and loved ones! Get a complimentary Bak Chang on us when you buy a bag of 6, or grab 2 for free when you purchase 10.
