@Florence Sjah Tien Court is a well-loved restaurant serving contemporary Cantonese dishes and acclaimed dimsum. Helmed by the award-winning chef Lui Wing Keung, it has launched its Lunar New Year dine-in and More takeaway menu. Featured here is the Kung Fu Pot, available for dine-in ($268++) and takeaway ($268 nett with claypot, $218 nett in vacuum-sealed pack only). The broth was comforting, filled with handmade sotong balls, scallops, fish maw with prawn paste, cabbage parcels stuffed with crabmeat, and more. Btw, they're only selling 50 pots this year, so better make your reservation early! I also loved the Nian Gao ($18++ for dine in, $18 nett for takeaway). This Nian Gao is steamed, so it's healthier. it's made daily using brown sugar and covered with desiccated coconut, grounded peanut, and sesame seeds. PROMO Until 15 jan, customers can get 10% off takeaway orders! @brandcellar #copthornekings #tiencourt #singaporefood #sginsta #sginstagram #singapore #singaporelife #brandcellar #singaporeinsta #singaporeeats #sgcny #sgcny2022 #sgfoodblogger
