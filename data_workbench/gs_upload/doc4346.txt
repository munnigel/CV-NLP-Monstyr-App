Dear frenZ, A good happy hour means people are enjoying and relaxing as much as they want to for a great price. TUINA (Chinese medical massage) LiangYi TCM Tuina is not only a delicate energy medicine, but also a kind of physical physical work. As a physical therapy, it is effective to loosen the tendons of the canal (generally called muscles, tendons, ligaments) and promote the movement of joints. As a form of energy medicine, I use energy from my hands to points, organs and bones along the canal. Tuina can be powerful or subtle, depending on the need for treatment.
