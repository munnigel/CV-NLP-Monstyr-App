R A Y E N C H E O N G S A M D R E S S If lady-like elegance is what you're looking for in this CNY, then its most obvious tool is the Rayen sheath dress. Details: This slightly form-fitting More dress made of TENCEL Lyocell eco-fibre gently grazes your figure down to the knees. We recommend pairing this dress with a pair of heels to make your legs appear longer. The high empire seamed waist is slightly cinched showing off the figure ever so delicately. Its bareback feature adds a touch of provocativeness. In a nutshell, Rayen is equal parts elegant yet sexy. . . . Available for PRE-ORDER online and in the showroom.
