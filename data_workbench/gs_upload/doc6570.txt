@ "For $18.80, we managed to get a huge portion of Mala!!! I'm more of a veggie & noodle fan for mala so I only included some fish meat inside! But spammed my cabbage, Maggie More Mee, lotus root, black fungus, mushrooms. It was a better idea asking for lesser oil & lesser salt. ( Less Spicy ) was a great choice too; as the spices used were sufficient for a good kick! Mala is just so painfully addictive " Dragon-Fly Mala Fragrant Hot Pot Bukit Panjang: Blk 259 Bt Panjang Ring Rd, #01-36 Opening hours: 12pm - 12am Blk 417 Yishun Ave 11, #01-351 Opening hours: 12pm - 12am Island-wide delivery : bit.ly/KSLOrder Also available on GrabFood Reposting @natfatdiaries #kimsanleng # #coffeeshop #streetfood #Singapore #SGunited #sgfood #sghawkerculture #mala #malaxiangguo
