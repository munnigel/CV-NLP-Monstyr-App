Newly opened about two months ago, Chocoelf Cafe boasts the full range of Chocoelf's products, specialty coffee and gelato. Chocoelf is a homegrown Singapore brand and their focus has always been to make More healthier sugar using little or no sugar at all. Their chocolates are made in Singapore and delivered fresh from their full-facility factory in Jurong. They offer a wide range of chocolates for various occasions such as birthdays and festive periods such as Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day. With Easter just around the corner, Chocoelf has created specialty chocolates for the Easter season, like the Easter Basket Gift set and Easter Egg in Bunny Box. The Easter Egg in Bunny Box can be enjoyed on its own, or put in a hot cup of milk to become a hot chocolate drink!
