We're often asked how we suggest storing ties, and hanging is always our answer. Let gravity take care of most of the wrinkles, and don't sweat the rest. Our new necktie hangers are made in Japan by a company that has dedicated the last 7 decades to perfecting just one thing - wooden hangers. Suffice to say, these are pretty darn nice hangers. The quality of wood, chrome, and the overall finishing is as perfect as you can imagine a hanger to be - a smooth satin finish on the wood, robust hardware that swivels with just the right amount of resistance, and of course - absolutely no sharp edges to snag your precious grenadine ties. These hangers hold up to 12 neckties each, and are available in natural and smoked brown stained beech wood with chrome hardware. Preorders are now open for our hangers, and they are priced at 10% off our regular price of S$60 for a single piece or S$110 for a set of 2 pieces. This preorder will last for 5 days until 15 February 2022 at 2000hrs (GMT +8). The hangers will be ready for delivery around mid-end March 2022.
