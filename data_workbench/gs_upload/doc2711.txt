NEW IN THE SHOP! We've got headbands and neck gaiters from rabbit! Yes, you can use a neck gaiter as a headband (and we've done it many times), but on hot days you want as little material as possible. These More rabbit headbands (another collaboration with BOCO Gear) are made from moisture-wicking polyester that will keep you dry and comfortable throughout your run. Ladies, they also work when you're not running. Do you need another headband? You probably do! And the rabbit neck gaiters are made in collaboration with BOCO, which you know for their great hats. The rabbit neck gaiter is durable, soft, breathable and moisture-wicking, made from seamless brushed stretch polyester, and of course it's machine-washable. Wear it as a neck gaiter, 'do rag, headband, hair tie or face mask. As always, check 'em out in the shop or online at https://www.rdrc.sg/collections/rabbit. #reddotrunningcompany #reddotrunningco #rdrcsg @runinrabbit #runinrabbit
