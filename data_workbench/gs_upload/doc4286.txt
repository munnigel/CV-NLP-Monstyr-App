If you haven't already knew, we recently launched our healthier version of Handmade Oyster Mee Sua. It is made healthier with Alchemy Fibre. You might ask "What is Alchemy Fibre?" Alchemy Fibre powders are More blends made of low GI, high fibre, and high prebiotics plant-based fibres. Different blends of Alchemy Fibre are used in different carbs. For our Handmade Oyster Mee Sua, the blend of Alchemy Fibre used is made from a blend of inulin and edible gum. Inulin is a type of dietary fibre that is found naturally in a variety of plants such as the chicory root.
