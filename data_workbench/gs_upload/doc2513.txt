A morning hanging out in Sarah's (@sarahhuangbenjamin) home, savouring a variety of coffee concoctions, playing with 1 out of 2 of her fur balls , Porridge, & occasionally, the shy sister, Sambal. Our limited edition collection BTV_MRNG seamlessly found itself into the nooks of Sarah's vibrant space. Starting her food blog since 2011, hosting TV shows and coming in hot as the winner of the Food Hero competition, Sarah Huang Benjamin has been making her mark in the TV food scene. Her English-Chinese heritage & exciting travels have shaped her deep passion for cooking heavenly food for anyoneee to plate! We sought the help of food enthusiast to make our @beyondthevines & @drinkmorning collaboration come alive! Launching this Friday, 5 Nov, 12pm (GMT +8), BTV_MRNG COLLAB is coming soon! #beyondthevines
