Pre-order for Healing the Emptiness opened. 'Healing the Emptiness' by Yasmin Mogahed About the book: A Guide to Emotional and Spiritual Well-being At some level, so many of us have experienced emptiness. But very few people know why. And even fewer people know how to fill that emptiness. But we spend our lives trying... This life and our entire journey here, is not an end in itself. It is a purposeful process, designed by God to shape our hearts. To prepare our souls for the Final Meeting with Him. We must allow the process to refine and remake us. And our wounds are a part of that process. It will hurt. It will seem like the end so many times. But it is not the end. Our journey will keep going and we can rise out of our pain, stronger. And then in the End, it won't be how we walked in the sun-but how we handled the storm-that will define us. It won't be about how we ran. It will be about how we fell, and then got back up. This book is about finding strength in God and in our capacity to be both human and beautiful--both flawed and inspired. It is a journey to the understanding that we are flawed by design so that we can find strength and beauty in relying entirely on the Flawless. This book is about learning why we suffer and how to stop our pain from destroying us. It is a spiritual and psychological manual for healing and growth through our pain. It is about finding peace and purpose, no matter what we've been through. #wardahbooks #bookhighlights #currentlyreading #bookstagram
