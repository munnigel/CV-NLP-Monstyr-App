In 2021, 982000 tonnes of plastic waste was generated in Singapore, and only 6% was recycled. Let's do our part and take a step towards a greener tomorrow. Say no to plastic bags and bring your own reusable bag when shopping at SPC. From 1 July 2022, $0.10 will be charged per transaction for plastic bags issued at all SPC Service Stations. All proceeds will be used to support charitable programmes/sustainability-related initiatives. #SPC #SPCSingapore #BYOB #SayNoToPlasticBag
