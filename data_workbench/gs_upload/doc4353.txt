Chic. Spacious. Sturdy. This tote bag was designed by our ex-Design intern, Adele. In one of the brainstorming sessions, she suggested coming up with a reusable tote bag for the festive season. As part of More Kinohimitsu's commitment to empower young local talents, we gave her the full support in making this happen. You can now get one for free when you make a minimum purchase of $150 on our official e-store. It is available in limited quantities only during this festive season, so fastest fingers first!
