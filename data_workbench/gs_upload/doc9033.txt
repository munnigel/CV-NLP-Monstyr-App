Unveiling the Rendez-Vous Dazzling Star, a new dreamy timepiece recreating an enchanting celestial phenomenon on the wrist: the shooting star. Defying the laws of horology, the new Rendez-Vous Dazzling Star captures the romance and unpredictability of shooting stars thanks to an entirely new mechanism conceived and developed within the Manufacture, the Calibre 734. In doing so, our watchmakers have succeeded in an unprecedented feat of capturing a random cosmic phenomenon in a watchmaking complication where everything is expressed through precisely calibrated, mathematical rhythms.
