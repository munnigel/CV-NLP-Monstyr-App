[NEW] Introducing the limited-edition Cedella Marley x Fossil collection at OG People's Park This International Women's Day, Fossil has partnered with author, designer and recording artist Cedella Marley to create a collection with reggae roots. Inspired by her father Bob Marley's hit single "One Love" and her Jamaican heritage, this colourful watch embodies the spirit of togetherness. This Carlie watch set is available in a limited edition of only 715 pieces with a specially etched caseback. As part of Fossil's #MakeTimeForGood initiative, 25% of proceeds from this collection will be donated to World Pulse, a non-profit organisation that uses social networking to drive social change by empowering women. Priced at $329, the timepiece comes with a rose gold-tone bracelet, interchangeable with a colourful leather strap.
