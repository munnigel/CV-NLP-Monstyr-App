Set your sights further with the new RF800mm f/5.6L IS USM and RF1200mm f/8L IS USM super-telephoto RF lenses. With amazing size and weight reduction, both are designed to be significantly smaller and lighter, while offering impressive focal length and image stabilisation. You can also achieve even greater focal lengths by pairing them with RF extenders, making it possible to get larger close-ups without compromising on image quality.
