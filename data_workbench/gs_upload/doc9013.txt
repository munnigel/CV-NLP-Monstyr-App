As a part of the Polar Puffs & Cakes x Tinkle Arts collaboration, the "Little Big Dreamers" collection has characters that are inspired by the children in our lives. Let's welcome Billie the curious astronaut More monkey! Since Billie was a little monkey, he has always wanted to explore outer space. And one special day, his wish came true! Billie got to go on an expedition through outer space, exploring different planets, and meeting all sorts of different people and creatures. Everyday is a new opportunity, from meeting his new neighbour Andie the shy space bear, to why the sky is his favourite shade of blue. With every question he asked, Billie gain more new knowledge. "Don't be afraid to ask."
