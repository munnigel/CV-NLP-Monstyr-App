[Open Call for Singapore-based independent practitioners ] If you're looking for a free space to create and exhibit your work, our HEARTH art space is now accepting applications for projects running between April to July 2022. Starting this year, we will also be offering micro-grants of up to S$500 per project to defray production costs incurred in the presentation of your work at HEARTH. Applications close 7 March at 4pm SGT. Click https://bit.ly/3KNg83m to learn more and apply now! To institute a layer of accountability and encourage more diverse projects, your application will be reviewed by a panel of appointed emerging practitioners. HEARTH was first launched in 2020 and has since supported 29 projects and over 120 practitioners. The initiative is made possible with the support of the Sands Cares Accelerator, a three-year non-profit capacity-building programme by Las Vegas Sands Corp.
