MODERN LUXURY Design for a 2-Room Condo (Another Weiken's project at Mount Vernon Road, Singapore) ----------------------------- "I was requested to create a design that attracted more natural light to the kitchen. As a result, I decided to knock a portion of the wall and put in a bar counter that made the entire living hall look more spacious and connected. Additionally, the homeowner was pretty keen on the grey tone, that's why I managed to mix the grey & brown together to bring the feeling of coziness & comfort into the home".
