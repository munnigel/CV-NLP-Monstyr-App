< NEW ARRIVAL > Wearable Art Graphic T-shirts by INTERNATIONAL IMAGES COLLECTION, featuring famous art photography works by renowned photographers. . Photo by Elsa Peretti, an Italian Model/Jewelry designer. She was the muse to popular American designer Halston and modeled for Helmut Newton in the seventies, and also famous for modernizing the Tiffany brand. The photo features a Playboy Bunny costumer made by Halston, with skyscrapers of New York City, 1975. . About the "Marshmallow" Material It is made by joining two layers of fabric together. Pursuing softness and lightness that cannot be thought of as 100% COTTON, it features a soft and fluffy feel like marshmallows. The fabric has tiny pores to keep it highly breathable and at the same time reduce the weight of the material. As the name suggests, it has a fluffy texture, so you can wear it like a sweatshirt. . . . #colonyclothing #newcolonialstyle #internationalimagescollection #elsaperetti #halston #playboybunny #photography #tshirtdesign
