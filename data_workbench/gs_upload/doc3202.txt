Singapore's multi-cultural heritage is best savoured through its diversity of food. At Violet Oon Singapore, our menus have been curated to a variety of heartwarming Singapore and Peranakan flavours. Our More version of Sugee Cake ($55+), a traditional baked treat of semolina and ground almonds, has long been regarded as a symbol of celebration and togetherness by the Eurasian community. A nutty, semolina-rich dessert topped with thinly sliced almonds, today we're proud to offer this nostalgic treat for celebrations big and small, as a reminder of the harmony between different cultures and families that's integral to the fabric of Singapore. To place your orders, please ring 9834 9935 or email eat@violetoon.com. Kindly place orders 3 days in advance by 3pm, or at least 5 days in advance for orders of 10 cakes or more. #VioletOonSingapore #VOSIonOrchard #MadeWithPassionSg
