We have some fizzy and bubbly good news to share!
From today onwards, our Deer fans can get to enjoy our new seasonal Ginger Ale Tea Series! If you like Ginger Ale, these soda teas are a MUST TRY!
First up, we have Mango Green Tea Ginger Ale with Green Tea Jelly! This is made with a good mixture of Mango Green Tea and Ginger Ale. To give more texture to the drink, we paired it with our Green Tea Jelly topping! It's fizzy, just right the amount sweet and refreshing!
Lime Peach Oolong Macchiato on the other hand is refreshingly sour! With our signature Peach Oolong Tea & Ginger Ale, top off with a blanket of velvety Himalayan Salt Macchiato Cream and fresh lime slices in this soda tea, this drink sure has the flavours and textures covered!
Head down to any of our outlets (except Jewel) to try them out now!
