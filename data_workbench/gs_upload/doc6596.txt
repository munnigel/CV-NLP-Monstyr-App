NEW IN THE SHOP! We've got an awesome new t-shirt in the shop from our friends in Japan at Answer4. If you've ever run 100 miles, you probably know that at points, it sucks! The answer(4), of course, is to "stop thinking, start running"! Check out this tee, as well as other great Answer4 gear. We've just restocked their "Running Sucks" PVC (waterproof!) wallet, we've got an awesome cowbell (a must-have for support crews!), and we've got their Focus Light 7L pack (in the limited edition Dazzle design). Check it all out in the shop or online at www.rdrc.sg/collections/answer-4! #rdrcsg #reddotrunningcompany #reddotrunningco @answer_4 #answer4 #runningsucks
