We've launched our very own lamb patties, straight from our butchers! We source from the best farms to provide high quality lamb patties that are skilfully prepared and marinated, and ready for your grilling needs anytime! After you've grilled up the patties, set them aside to rest, slice the buns up and grill them too. Add a generous serving of goat's cheese then assemble the burger together with our Little Farms' salad mixes, and we're pretty sure it'll pack a really delicious bite!
