Sharing the first look at Baobab Collection's all-new "Rainforest" (Limited Edition). The goal of this collection is to highlight the natural world through glass colors. As a tribute to the world's largest More forests, three candles have been added to the collection: Amazonia, Tanjung, and Mayumbe. Despite the fact that they are from the same collection, their fragrances will transport you to a completely different world. The fragrance of Amazonia is bergamot, green tea, and Atlas cidar, while Mayumbe is black pepper and galbanum, and Tanjum will transport you to the freshness of a tropical forest.
