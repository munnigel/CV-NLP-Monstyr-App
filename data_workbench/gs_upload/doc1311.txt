Celebrating the card game UNO's 50th anniversary, these pair of AF1s are unmistakably UNO-themed, featuring all the colours that you'd typically find within the game. UNO's logo graces the lateral side of the shoe, marking a collaborative project that will go down in the sneaker's history books. --------------------------------- Members Online Ballot | 31 Jan --------------------------------- Members may place their entries by logging in to vipbooking.limitededt.com from 3pm-9pm today.
