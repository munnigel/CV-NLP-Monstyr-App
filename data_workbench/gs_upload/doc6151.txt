[NEW] 1670 Anniversary Ink 50ml Shogun Kenzo Takada & K3 by @jacquesherbin.official - Kenzo Takada is recognized worldwide as one of the most famous creators and designers of his generation. His recognizable style combines multicultural inspirations with a distinct Japanese touch. Kenzo Takada sadly passed away just as the partnership with Jacques Herbin, who was dear to him, had started.This ink is thus a homage to this exceptional man. - This twilight-colored ink, reminiscent of a beautiful night of stars, is coated with fine red and gold shimmer. The resulting hue is reminiscent of certain armors from the Shogun era, for which Kenzo Takada held a fine appreciation. - Get it now at our retail or web store! - #OverjoyedXYZ #IAmOverjoyed #AnotherReasonToBeOverjoyed #Jacques #Herbin #Shogun #Kenzo #Takada #Shimmer #Fountain #Pen #Ink #Writing #Journaling #SGArtStore #TheCathay
