We are launching some new dons tomorrow! From 1 Nov, we will be refreshing our seasonal dons selection Introducing our - we have upgraded our butadon cut to or "the More butchers secret". A cut so tender and highly-prized that many butchers refused to share it in the past! This butadon is available in two flavours original and mentaiko! The second dish that we'll be launching is our flame torched ! After months of preparation, we have finally perfected this juicy, tender chicken bowl, which now comes braised in a house made dark soy-dashi broth that results in a sweet, umami laden mouthful of smoky goodness. Served with Japanese rice and an onsen egg. Have a go at our new dishes! They will have available from 1 Nov (Mon) in-stores and online via www.waacow.sg.
