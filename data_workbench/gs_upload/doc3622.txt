Give Fresh Air is a community initiative by Nike that unifies the Sneaker Community around a shared passion to ignite change. Give "AIR" through shoe donations that support local non-profit organisations. We More partnered up with @soles4souls a non-profit organisation that turns shoes into opportunity by providing relief, creating jobs and empowering people to break the cycle of poverty.
