Hooray! Officially launching our collaboration with the world's most awarded airline, Singapore Airlines! Every bundle is a collectible in support of purposeful upcycling. They are created with retired aircraft materials. Through this collaboration, Singapore Airlines and Ying The Label fabrics are artistically blended together, turning every creation into a wearable art. Every design is one-of-a-kind and instinctive. Exclusively available at Ying The Label's webstore, atelier and KrisShop's webstore.
