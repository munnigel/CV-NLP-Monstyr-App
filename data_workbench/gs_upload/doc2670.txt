Bettinardi Inovai 6.0 Spud putter. INOVAI 6.0 Spud was designed by Sam Bettinardi to perfect our most successful M.O.I. (Moment of Inertia) mallet to date. With two years of Tour feedback, Sam refined the 6.0 with a 5% smaller head from heel to toe, offering a sleek, more compact design than its predecessor. INOVAI 6.0 has consistently been in play by multiple Bettinardi staffers on Tour since its initial release in 2020.
