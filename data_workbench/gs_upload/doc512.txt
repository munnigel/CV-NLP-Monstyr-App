Agam Theatre Lab is thrilled to be presenting the world premiere of this dramatic adaptation by Cultural Medallion recipient P Krishnan. Originally adapted in 1971 in its entirety, only a fraction of the play was aired on the radio for two hours in May 1971. 50 years on, this play will be staged as a full-length production for the first time ever. Assembled by an award-winning creative team, Animal Farm is a dynamic, daring and contemporary take on a timeless story. BOOK NOW https://bit.ly/36qtO5f
