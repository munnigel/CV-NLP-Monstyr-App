HENG ONG HUAT with Huggs! Forget renting a boyfriend or girlfriend, bring some Huggs home this Chinese New Year instead! Perfectly sized for small gatherings! Here is what you can expect this festive season: Peach Green Tea Beat the heat with a sip and enjoy the tropics in your mouth! Note that the takeaway cup should be used to carry said drink only. Any unauthorized drink storage will be met with disapproving head shakes! Huggs' Non-woven Bag Come rain or shine, our trusty bag carries your essential Huggs goods, leaving your hands free for important tasks like collecting red packets and handing over oranges. Chilli Crab Pie - Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served. Each pie is carefully balanced for optimized nutrition and maximum flavor. Can also be used as a close combat instrument in extreme circumstances (not recommended). Orh Nee Cake Replacing your standard post-meal dessert, we bring you our latest culinary innovation. Filled to the brim with delicious orh nee, you'll need a god-dang yambulance by the time you're done. Everyone has places to go, but only one to come back to and it's home. Let us celebrate the bonds that make us and the people we love. As Vin Diesel says, there's nothing stronger than family and that's what you are to us @ Huggs! #huggscoffee #huggssg #huggs #coffee #orhneecake #mahjong #exploresingapore #cny2022 #chinesenewyear #chinesenewyear2022
