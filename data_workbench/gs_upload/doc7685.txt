NEW - Cargo Lid lock. S$45. Yes this item is for use with Tern's Cargo bikes sold very well in the USA and Europe. (Unfortunately LTA's guidelines for ebikes do not cover this category of ebikes) The Cargo More Lid Lock is an extra-long cable lock (2.5m) designed for use with the Storm Box's Cargo Lid. The Cargo Lid lock allows 2 bikes to be secured to prevent opportunity theft. Thin in design, it allows you to string items such as the saddle and seatpost and child seats or if you have 2 bikes - side by side. Weighs only 200grams. If you need to pick up one, no need to make an appointment, but expect to wait if the store has more than 5 pax inside and staff will ask for sighting of vaccination records.
