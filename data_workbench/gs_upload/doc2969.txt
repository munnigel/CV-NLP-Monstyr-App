Let's share the spirit of Ramadan and spread festive joy through our donations. This April, we're partnering with The Food Bank Singapore and Food from the Heart (Singapore) for a food donation drive. From 3 April to 2 May, you can donate food items through our food charity partners at selected FairPrice stores.
