Our signature High Tea sets hold a special place in our hearts. Designed for two, we hope that our curated menu of scrumptious bites offers some of our busiest diners a pause in their day to enjoy a few sweet and savoury treats. Presented in a three-tier, tingkat-inspired serving platter, it includes signature Singaporean and Peranakan nibbles like Coronation Chicken and Kueh Pie Tee, as well as our steamed Kueh Koh Swee, buttery Kueh Beng Kah, and moist Sugee Financiers. Join us for High Tea from 3pm to 5:30pm (last order: 4.30pm) daily at Violet Oon Singapore at ION Orchard, or from Fridays to Sundays and public holidays at the National Kitchen. Please note that our High Tea menus differ at each restaurant, please ring / WhatsApp 9834 9935 (after 10am) or visit violetoon.com for reservations. #VioletOonSingapore #VOSNationalKitchen #VOSIonOrchard #MadeWithPassionSg
