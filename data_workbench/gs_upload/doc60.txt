CHRISTMAS Santa Meringue (NEW!) Light, airy and sweet would be how we describe this delicate Santa hat. Traditionally made from whipped egg whites and sugar, we have given our usual meringue an overhaul More to suit the Christmas season. It's also coated with white chocolate on the outside as well as desiccated coconut!
