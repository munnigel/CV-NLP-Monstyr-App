IUIGA x Geneco #PowerTheChange Giving and receiving red packets is a long-standing tradition of CNY and one that symbolises good wishes and luck for the year ahead. While most of us continue to practise this yearly tradition, we can still #PowerTheChange and do our part for the environment during this festive period. Last year we partnered with Geneco in a successful initiative where more than 410kg of used red packets were collected and recycled. Join us again in Geneco's #ChangeBringsProsperity initiative by dropping off your used/excess red packets in any Used Red Packets Recycling Bins, placed at our 15 stores island-wide! They will be there till 6 March - these collected red packets will then be sent to @TayPaperRecycling to be pulped and made into other paper products. Swipe for a step-by-step guide to make your used red packets green! @genecosg
