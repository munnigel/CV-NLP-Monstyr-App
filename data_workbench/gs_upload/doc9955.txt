The Tuareg TV Dresser helps to frame the living room with its varying shades and textures - a natural result of decades of natural weathering on reclaimed Teak wood. Paired with sleek dark iron, the d-Bodhi Tuareg TV Dresser comes with 2 swing doors and 2 drawers, keeping your items neatly stored within to retain a simple minimalist look.
