GO PURPLE OR GO HOME! We've just received a shipment of new special edition T8 Sherpa shorts ... in performance purple! You know the T8 Sherpa, which is a favorite for road and trail runners who want to More carry their essentials phone, keys, water, gels hands-free while they run. The Sherpa waistband is made of hyper-stretch mesh that holds up to 2L or 1kg with minimal bounce, and the shorts have a bunch of great details (one of the benefits of runners designing for runners) such as a key holder, detachable race bib holders and T8's PhoneLock secure rear pocket. Over the years we've seen these available in black , blue , white , red , British racing green and now purple! Check 'em out in the shop or online at https://www.rdrc.sg/collections/t8-1. #reddotrunningcompany #reddotrunningco #rdrcsg #t8run @t8.run
