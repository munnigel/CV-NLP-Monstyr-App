Group Therapy started as in 2011 as a collective events space along Duxton road, and in March 2020 moved to its current location at Cross Street Exchange. The cafe is popular for its coffee and breakfast More options, serving a wide range of items such as pancakes, eggs and brunch, salads/sandwiches and even waffles. Those who want something more filling can choose from their mains, pastas and hand-stretched 9-inch pizzas. There is also an option for diners to create their own plate, so they can have their very own customised brunch/breakfast plate of their favourite items!
