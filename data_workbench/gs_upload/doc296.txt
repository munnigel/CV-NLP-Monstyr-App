[NEW] Super Granulation Watercolor by @schmincke_official - Desert, Volcano, and Shire sets are now available in our store! - The distinctive feature of the entire line of Schmincke Horadam super granulation paints is the principle of pigment selection. Only pigments that have a natural tendency to granulate are used and specially selected for these paints. Some of their paints can beautifully fall apart into two pigments that complement each other. All paints in the series are highly lightfast and are predominantly semi-opaque or semi transparent. - Check out the colors today at our retail or web store! - #OverjoyedXYZ #IAmOverjoyed #AnotherReasonToBeOverjoyed #Schmincke #Super #Granulation #Horadam #Watercolor #Painting #FineArts #Limited #Edition #Special #Volcano #Desert #Shire #SGArtStore #TheCathay
