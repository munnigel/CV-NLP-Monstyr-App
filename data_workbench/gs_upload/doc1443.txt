Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful mums out there! "The best seafood in the world" is what our Executive Chef Hoo has always hoped to cook for his mum. That's the inspiration behind his new Braised More Nepalese Rice with Abalone and Sea Urchin. This exquisite dish now features in one of Chef Hoo's Mother's Day menus, which you can enjoy too! Our Mother's Day menus are available at all three outlets till 31 May. Dine with us to receive a pair of Lee Kum Kee's seafood XO sauces to delight your mum with! More at https://bit.ly/3rTsuiG.
