A fabulous home for the fine feline, we present the brand new Cat Cave, designed by Stefano Giovannoni for Qeeboo . It is composed of two overlapping stones: the bottom cave has a scratching mat on the floor More and a soft ball hanging from the ceiling. The top one is characterized by a porthole that allows the cat to enter, protect himself and examine the outside world, planning the next domestic attack.
