Create daylight environment. Anytime.. Anywhere LIGHTCRAFT is proud to introduce FAUX-SUN. FAUX-SUN system allows you to bring artificial sunlight into your built environment where there are no windows to allow natural sunlight in. It is well know that sunlight lifts the mood and people feel happier in sunlit spaces The Faux-Sun system allows you to do just that. With white color tuning, it is possible to change the color temperature: warm morning sun, bright daylight at mid-day and even warmer color temperature in the late afternoon. This helps to reinforce the circadian rhythm of your body and helps to regulate wakefulness and sleep. Color change is programmed into the system and automatic. And of course, there is the dimming function to let you choose just the right amount of light. Drop by our showroom @ 11 Kaki Bukit View and have a feel of FAUX-SUN. #_home_decors #_interior_designers #lightingdesigner #skylight #sunlight
