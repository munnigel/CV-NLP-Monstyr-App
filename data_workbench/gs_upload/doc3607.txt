(Dragon Boat festival) originated in ancient China based on the suicide of the poet and statesman of the Chu kingdom, Qu Yuan, who drowned in 278 BCE. The local Chinese attempted to save him by rowing More their boats out in search of his body, but to no avail. Subsequently, they started making Rice Dumplings () as a sacrificial offering to him. Today, we continue to honour Qu Yuan, with these Hand-made Rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves. Now available on Imperial Treasure's e-store, choose from flavours such as Pork, Dried Scallop, or Lotus Seed Paste.
