One of the purposes we had for Tempur Experiential Centre was for it to be a space where everyone could learn about how to sleep better and wake up feeling great. Hence we are organizing our first ever Coffee X More Sleep workshop on Wed 27 Jul in partnership with MJ Coffee Co. Tickets are open for booking (from now till 23 July) on our partner's website: https://www.mjcoffeeco.online/services-1
