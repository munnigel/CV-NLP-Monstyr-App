We have partnered with The Fashion Pulpit on a fashion swapping programme in February and March! A responsible fashion ecosystem starts with swapping. This is a sustainable way to enjoy fashion without overconsumption of natural resources or contributing to more waste. Take part in this circular solution in fashion and have fun searching for new gems!
