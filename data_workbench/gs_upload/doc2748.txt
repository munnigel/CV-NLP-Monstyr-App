It's one more month to Chinese New Year and with the current dining regulations, we seek your understanding that we may not be able to accommodate as many guests as we used to at our restaurants. Do book your reunion lunch or dinner early if you are dining out on Chinese New Year Eve, at either Red House Seafood Grand Copthorne or Red House Seafood Clarke Quay. For a preview of our Chinese New Year dine-in menus launching 17 January, visit bit.ly/RHcny2022 #redhouseseafood #redhouse #seafood #sgfoodies #sgmakan #gathering #forkyeah #chineserestaurant #festivemenu #cnymenu #cnyspecials #cny2022 http://www.redhouseseafood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CNY_2022-menu.pdf?utm_content=sked_61c578b41d48e70f61bb0907&utm_medium=social&utm_name=sked&utm_source=facebook
