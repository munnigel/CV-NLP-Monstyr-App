*Louis Durian gives back* *0 gimmicks, just want to give* Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we understand that many people are less able to afford durian as it is expensive. As such we would like to giveaway durians for free since it is peak season now, so that you can enjoy the King of Fruits with your family members. This upcoming Wednesday and Thursday (15/6-16/6), Louis Durian will be giving away 1 durian for each elderly citizen (60 yrs old and above) at our stall. In total we have 500kg+ of durian to be given out! *Address*: Blk 85 Marine Parade, #01-662, S(440085) *Time*: 4pm onwards, until all is given out See you all there, what are you waiting for
