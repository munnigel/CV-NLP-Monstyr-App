In the sixth edition of the Wu Guanzhong Exhibition Series, : looks at the artist's life and art practice through the eyes of our volunteer docent community. Guided by the journeys of four docents, the exhibition attempts to convey the multiple aspects of "travelling", and how Wu's art has inspired the docents to recollect and reconnect with times of carefree exploration by sharing personal stories and photographs. The exhibition opens 9 July. More updates coming soon so watch this space! #WuGuanzhong #TravellingWithTheMaster #NationalGallerySingapore #LetArtSurpriseYou
