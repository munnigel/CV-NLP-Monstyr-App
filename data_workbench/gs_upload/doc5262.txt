For the new #LongchampFW21 collection, Sophie Delafontaine chose to put forward an innovative approach to line, function, colour and material, carefully combining with the creative spirit of Longchamp. Quilts and layers are in the spotlight as well as our new It-accessory: The LGP Jacquard Canvas bucket Hat. Capturing both the mischievous energy and the mysterious charm of Longchamp's Parisienne. #LongchampFashionShow #ParisFashionWeek http://ow.ly/PWGS50DJFX3
