Heavenly rose is made when skins of red grapes are strained in wine for just a few hoursas opposed to weeks like some red wines. Generally, rose will taste of fruity flavours like melon, citrus, flowers, and red fruit with a rhubarb or celery finish. That leaves a lot of room for variation and exploration. So let's raise a glass, cheers, and then discover the joys of a glass of rose.
