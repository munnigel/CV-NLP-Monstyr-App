From the 23rd of April, Crane's Attic at Arab Street will don a veil of luminous gloom. Step into the world of German artist @ma_knut_'s oil-based paintings and stay on your toes for paranormal activity A More preamble to Ma Knut's iterative collaboration with Crane's very own Shaiful Risan, this joint curatorship provides a sneak peek into a new way of working in the visual arts, with a nod to spatial appropriation as the world enters a new frontier and we reconnect in the wake of the pandemic. What's more, the works of Ma Knut will be on sale! Registration is free, so sign-up and come visit for an exhibition like no other! Dates: Sat, 23 Apr to Fri, 29 Apr Time*: 3-9pm *The opening hours are correct for this Exhibition Opening date only. Opening hours on other dates may differ, and are subject to Crane Arab St standard opening hours of 9am to 6pm unless otherwise stated. #artexhibition #artexhibitionsg #modernart #arabstreet #arabstreetart #WeAreCrane
