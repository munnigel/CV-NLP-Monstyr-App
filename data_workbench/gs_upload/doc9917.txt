How about a Bria Rose for the woman who inspires you? The Bria Rose is a new liqueur-infused cake by Italian artisanal, family-owned pastry brand Pasticceria Bonci. The naturally leavened cake is inspired More and bathed in the feminine delicacy of Rosolio di Rose, a liqueur infused with organic rose petals. It is also enriched with drops of white chocolate and candied strawberries, and goes perfectly with cream, ice cream and even fresh fruit. #dapaolo #dapaolosg #everydayitalian #pasticceriabonci #bonci #liqueurcake #IWD #iwd2022 #internationalwomensday #sgcakes
