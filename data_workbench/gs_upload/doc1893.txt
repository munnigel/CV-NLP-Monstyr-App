New at TANGS Ferrari is a symbol of excellence, built to win on both road and track. This collection was created to bring this unique DNA to life through our three core iconic Cross collections, Century, More Century II, and Townsend. Signature design details include a pen clip artfully crafted and layered with classic Scuderia Ferrari colors revealed both in profile view and through a perforated clip modeled after the nose and cockpit of a Formula 1 car. Hand-polished finishes express the concepts of innovation and technology, reflecting the materials used in the vehicles themselves.
