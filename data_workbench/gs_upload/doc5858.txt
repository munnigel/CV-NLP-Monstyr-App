NEW IN THE SHOP! We love Brendan Leonard (author of "I Hate Running and You Can Too") and when we saw he had a new book out, we had to order it (and get him to sign every copy!). You've seen Brendan's graphic More charts in Outside magazine (and we've posted them here) and he's a great inspiration to us because he hates running (like we do, sometimes). Brendan hates running so much that he once logged 52 marathon-length runs in 52 weeks. This new book, "Have Fun Out There Or Not: The Semi-Rad Running Essays", comprises 25 essays, race reports, illustrated stories, and goofy lists, and according to Brendan, includes no real training tips, except maybe the one on page 69 about how to go No. 2 in the woods and keep your hands 100 percent clean while doing it. Check it out online at www.rdrc.sg/collections/books or in the shop! #reddotrunningcompany #reddotrunningco #rdrcsg @semi_rad
