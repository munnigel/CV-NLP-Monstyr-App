Named to honour Michael Pozzan's grandmother, Annabella wines are considered to be Napa's prized varietal, especially their Cabernet Sauvignon. Whether cabernet sauvignon, merlot or chardonnay, these wines are a toast to a spirited woman of remarkable grace. Bursting with characteristic creme cases, boysenberry, and milk chocolate on the nose, in the mouth the wine blooms with black plum, cranberry, cocoa powder, and a hint of mission fig.
