LIMITED EDITION - UGANDA OBWOKYI Hey SG and MY fam! We're thrilled that our new Limited Edition is from Uganda! Obwokyi means honey in the local Rukiga language spoken in and around the Bwindi farm. The More term 'honey' relates to the 'mucilage' (the sweet and sticky substance like honey) left on the coffee bean. You'll be sure to enjoy the complex fruity notes (Mango, maple syrup, blackcurrant) that we find well exhibited in a medium roast. Hurry, grab yours while supplies last! . . . . . #perkcoffeeco #coffeeloversoftheworld #coffeevibes #coffeedaily #coffeedelivery #expatlife #singaporelife #singapore_insta #singaporeinsiders #singaporecoffee #sgcafe #malaysianfoodie #coffeemalaysia #cafehopkl #cafehoppingsg #coffeeoclock #cafestagram #filtercoffee #coffeebean #singleorigin #pourover #coffeeroasting #thetrendybarista #thirdwavecoffee
