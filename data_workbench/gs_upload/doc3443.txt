#IDOTG21Stories "My dearest girls... As you grow older, you will start to realise that society might not be very kind to you and all the other girls around you... People will always have something to say - not only about our gender, the colour of our skin, the size of our bodies, but also when we show that we are powerful, strong and independent. But remember what I've always told you.. Nobody can love you if you don't love yourself first. Embracing your flaws, both inside and out, and building on your strengths will bring you great confidence and endless opportunities in life. The only limits you see are the ones you impose on yourself. Don't ever let anyone dull your sparkle. Love Mummy Celebrating International Day Of The Girl with @thebodyshopsg. The Body Shop will donate $1 for every NEW Body Butter purchased in stores from now till 11 Oct in support of Daughters Of Tomorrow to shape minds, body positivity and confidence for their community, empowering women through economic means to build a better tomorrow for families." : @missyqiqi
