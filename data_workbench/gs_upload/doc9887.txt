The menu for this week is now available with ala carte main courses starting from $4.50 (& up). Our menu items are still available ready to eat & chilled. Just a reminder that cake orders for Chinese New Year will close today. Limited quantities of cakes will be available daily for walk in sales as our priority will be on order fulfillment. The cafe will be closed from CNY eve till the 2nd day of CNY. Business will resume on 3/2/22. We remain OPEN for dine in; but can only accommodate group sizes of up to 5 fully vaccinated individuals. For takeaways - we recommend you call in advance with your order to reduce your waiting time. Delivery service is available @ $15 per trip. To guarantee delivery by your preferred time, we recommend you order one day in advance so that we can secure you your preferred delivery time slot. Of course if you prefer, you are free to self-collect or arrange your own delivery (pick-up) service (eg. through Grab). In the meantime, please stay safe & take care! #SugeeCake #EurasianPie #ShepherdsPie #CurryDebal #CurryDevil #ChickenBuahKeluak #BeefSmore #PorkBuahKeras #SaltFishPickle #VegetableAchar #Takeaway #SugeeCakeIcing
