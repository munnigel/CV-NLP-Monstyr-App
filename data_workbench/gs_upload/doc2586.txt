S U R Y A C H E O N G S A M T W I N S E T Another bestselling two-piece Cheongsam from 2021 has been brought back due to popular demand! The Surya twin-set cheongsam comes in OA's favourite Water Well print. The image of small dots in concentric circles are meant to depict ripples when an object is placed in water. It serves as a visual reminder to practise mindfulness because our actions have a wider effect on our surroundings. Details: Its vest centres around the season's most covetable and sought after halter neckline, incorporating elements of a traditional cheongsam with the mandarin collar and Chinese knotted button closure down the centre of the bodice. Falling down near the ankles, this fit and flare vest comes with a pair of high waist wide-leg pants in identical prints, making this fancy get-up perfect for sitting and lounging at reunion dinners but also looks best in action. . .
