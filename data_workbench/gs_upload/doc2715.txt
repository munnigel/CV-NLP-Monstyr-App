"THE ROGER" is a sneaker project co-created by tennis superstar Roger Federer and On Running. THE ROGER is crafted using vegan leather and has been designed for lightness to reduce material consumption. Vegan More leather has approximately 30% of the footprint of animal leather. The upper features recycled materials too, with the mesh around the collar, the lining and the laces are all made from 100% recycled polyester. The result is a tennis-inspired sneaker with a significantly reduced environmental footprint. We are pleased to announce a selection of this collection including a new limited edition model will be available at KEVIN SEAH soon.
