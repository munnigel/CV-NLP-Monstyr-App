Unlike the sound waves created by a More conventional magnet, the special shape of Stealth Magnets enables the waves to pass through the magnets without generating interference. Hifiman's advanced magnet design is acoustically transparent, dramatically reducing wave diffraction turbulence that degrades the integrity of the sound waves. The reduced distortion yields pure sonic output that is accurate and full-range. The headphone's drivers are protected by a newly designed casing for enhanced durability and protection from the elements. A dual-sided high-performance 3.5mm cable is packaged with a 6.35mm adapter for maximum compatibility with a wide range of devices. #connectit #connectitsg #hifiman #he400se #hifimanhe400se #hifimanheadphones #headphones #audiophile #singapore #music #musiclover #sensitive #puresonicoutput #fullrangesound #fullrange #comfortable #durable
