What do you get when you combine a French classic with Singaporean flair? A delicious Pandan Flan, of course. Made in honour of @voilahsg 2021, this special pastry features creamy pandan custard encased in a More crunchy buttery crust. They'll be available at all outlets, in place of our vanilla flan from 3 Nov to 10 Dec. Get ready for the best of both worlds! #tiongbahrubakery
