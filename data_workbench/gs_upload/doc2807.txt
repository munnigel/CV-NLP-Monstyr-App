For its 40th Anniversary, Nike brings chocolate brown tones to its Air Force 1 High LV8 Vintage. White leather panels make up most of the shoe with the exception of the midfoot panel featuring a woven material for better ventilation. We see that beautiful dark chocolate brown on the Swoosh logos, outsole and on the interior sock liner. To round off the vintage look, the sneaker's midsole comes in a cream, off-white colour for that aged feel. -------------------------------------------- MEMBERS Online Reservation 12 MAY -------------------------------------------- Members may place their reservations by logging in to vipbooking.limitededt.com from 3pm-9pm today.
