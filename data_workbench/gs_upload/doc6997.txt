Ken Scott, an American designer living in Milan during the 60s and 70s, was known as the 'fashion gardener' for his signature, oversized botanical prints in a clash of colors. His favorite flowers included peonies, roses, poppies and sunflowers. For Gucci Epilogue, Alessandro Michele worked with Ken Scott archives to apply dense prints to ready-to-wear pieces and accessories.
