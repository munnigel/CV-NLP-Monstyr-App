Locherber Milano Banksia Diffuser (250ML - 2.5L) The new fragrance is inspired by the Australian Banksia flower and is made in Italy, with a lid made from the cone of this endangered species. On the left is the More banksia flower and on the right - banksia seed pod. The tree has flower spikes that die back to leave a cone, which is what the Locherber Milano craftsmen made the wooden bottle cap from after a great deal of skill and labor. Beginning with balsamic notes of Australian eucalyptus and citrusy grapefruit, the aromatic, woody, and spicy fragrance progresses to spicy notes. The finish is intense and enveloping, with woody notes of Australian sandalwood and cedarwood, as well as spicy vetiver and Banksia nectar.
