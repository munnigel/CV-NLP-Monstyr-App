Introducing the Tea Time series by Sailor, a new series designed to celebrate different tea time traditions practiced around the world. The first release in this series was inspired by Sweden. The Sailor Professional Gear FIKA Cup pen were designed to honor the Swedish tradition of Fika. Fika is an afternoon coffee break that is less about making a quick stop for a to-go cup, and more about the experience of savoring the moment (and a pastry) with a friend. Fika is such an integral part of Swedish culture that most companies require time away from work for this practice each day. . Sailor ProGear King of Pen and Professional Gear Fika Cup is inspired by the color of traditional Swedish ceramics with a transparent dark blue body and a light blue cap like the ceramic cup and dishes from the Fika Tea Time in Sweden and The Netherlands. . & : $ & : $ . ? ! ! #AestheticBay #EngagingYourSoul #Sailor #KOP #Special #Edition #ProGear #Tea #Time #Fika #Cup #Saucer #Fountain #Pen #Gift #Collectible #IONOrchard #Singapore
