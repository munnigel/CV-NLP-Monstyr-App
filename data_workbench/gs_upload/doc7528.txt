After celebrating Xiang Xiang 3 year's anniversary means our journey at Bedok Point will be ending less than 5 months. Our last day of operation is 28 December this year. Our initial thought of starting Xiang Xiang is to carry our 3 generation's taste. We learned the cooking & promised to continue the original traditional tastes so that people can enjoy the authentic traditional Taiwanese food, using natural ingredients without adding MSG or taste enhancers.
