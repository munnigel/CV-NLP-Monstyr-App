NEW IN THE SHOP! Naboso Technology creates small-nerve proprioceptive products that stimulate the nervous system and enhance movement. Now, in addition to Naboso insoles, the Naboso Neuro Ball, the Naboso Training Mat and Naboso Standing Mat, we've got the Naboso Knee High Recovery Sock, which allows you to release and recover your feet while simply walking around your home. Naboso's Knee High Recovery Sock is a graduated compressive sock, with proprioceptive texturing inside the sock that provides a mini-massage for your feet as you walk around your home at the end of the day or after a workout. The interaction of the textured material with the soles of your feet enhances circulation, stimulates your nerves and releases your muscles and fascia. Are you ready to treat your feet? Check out the Naboso Knee High Recovery Sock and the complete range of Naboso products in the shop, or at www.rdrc.sg/collections/naboso. #reddotrunningcompany #reddotrunningco #rdrcsg #nabosotechnology @naboso_technology
