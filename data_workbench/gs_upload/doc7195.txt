THE BLACKSMITH The Blacksmith is descended from a boot that was worn in farm fields and workshops by day and shined-up to go out at night. The 6-inch boot originally protected feet and ankles from hot cinders at the forge, and today it locks out dirt in the summer and snow in the winter. True to its roots, the Blacksmith blends construction and materials that create both rugged durability and handsome styling. Premium Red Wing Leather, a three-quarter Goodyear welt, and Puritan triple stitch sit on a Vibram 430 Mini-lug outsole that provides trustworthy all-season traction.
