Good things come in threes! Wilson, Sky and Shaun each got themselves a new Birdy City through our Refer a Friend promo! Sky bought a bike and referred Shaun. Both of them were present at the store when Shaun purchased his bike. After taking a picture of them together with the hashtag #MVReferAFriend, they were both able to enjoy $200 worth of online store credits! Shaun then referred Wilson, went through the same steps and both of them got $200 worth of credits as well! Want to know more about our Refer A Friend scheme?
