Hey Fam! We wanted to know what you would do with extra data, not enough data or no data at all to get you thinking about your data use priorities but we were wondering, did any of you consider donating your data? Well, if you did, now you can! We're happy to announce that we are introducing a brand-new data donation feature on our GOMO app to allow you to share your extra data with those in need. Stay tuned to find out how we can push a button for the ones that matter and use our #DataForGood to get #DataForAll
