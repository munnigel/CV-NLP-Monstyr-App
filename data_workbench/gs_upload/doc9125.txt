Forest Darts was established in 2005 initially as a karaoke pub and today it has grown to become one of the largest dedicated darts bars in Singapore with a total of five outlets. Forest Darts Cafe, which is More located in the vicinity of Chinatown at Ann Siang Road, spans over 2000 sq ft with karaoke facilities, alfresco seating, a pool table, eight Dartslive Boards and four traditional steel-tip boards. For the uninitiated, Dartslive machines automatically calculate scores and results of the darts games are saved online - players can check their scores on their smart phones or PCs.
