Having a cyclometer is good but more importantly for those who are pushing their fitness, make sure you have a Cadence sensor to keep your cycling between 75 - 95 cadence which is a good rule of thumb to avoid burning out. For those who have had a long time of non exercise, please consider getting a Heart Rate Strap or a exercise watch that reads your heart rate. We have a current promo S$99 for the XOSS G+ bundled with a Cadence sensor for only S$99. Heart Rate monitor is an additional S$49
