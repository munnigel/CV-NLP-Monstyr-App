Beast mode ON with the Gorilla Fastback GT Leon Racing. It's carbon fiber galore with Gorilla Watches' newest limited edition model. Produced in partnership with the Leon Pyramid AMG racing team, this is the More brand's first watch to feature a beautifully sculpted forged carbon bezel, dial and case. Its black-and-yellow strap is also designed from ground up, with shapes resembling the aero fender vents of the AMG GT300 race car. With only 300 pieces made worldwide, the Leon Racing is a compelling piece to add to your collection.
