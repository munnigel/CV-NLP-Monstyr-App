One of the most recognizable places in Dubrovnik Old Town would be the Onofrio's Fountain, providing the city with fresh spring water since 1438. It is a grand monument built to celebrate the completion of the Dubrovnik's waterworks, embellished by 16 stone carved masks. Since it's centrally located just off the Stradun, it's worth a visit while exploring Dubrovnik Old Town! Did you also know? The fountain is featured as a filming location for Game of Thrones! ---------------------------------- 11D8N D'BALKANS ADVENTURE (EZAG11) Qatar Airways Travel Period: Sep - Oct 2022 Itinerary: https://bit.ly/3wv8x4p Subscribe to our here for latest updates & travel promotions: https://t.me/namhotravel For more information, WhatsApp https://wa.me/6586862888 6221 8433 sales_enquiries@namho.com.sg https://namho.com.sg #NamHoTravel #Travel #Europe #Balkans
