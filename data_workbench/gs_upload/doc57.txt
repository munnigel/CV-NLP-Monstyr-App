Eid's time. Finally. After two long years apart, we can finally embrace each other, grip hands and seek forgiveness, and celebrate under one roof again. Many of you are already excited to place your orders for Eid so we've launched a category called "Eid Specials" on our website where you'll find our must-haves for a spectacular reunion-worthy feast. After all, food always tastes better with good company right? To make your celebrations even sweeter, enjoy 10% off the items in this category from now till 02.05.22 when you use the code: EIDSTIMETOFEAST Please note that we'll be closed on the first two days of Eid (3rd and 4th May) so do try to get your orders in by Sunday, 1st May, to last you through the extended holiday period. #themeaterysg #raya2022 #eid2022 #coveidnomore #eid #rayaready #yayyayhariraya #hariraya #halalfoodsg #sghalal #rendang #ketupat #lontong
