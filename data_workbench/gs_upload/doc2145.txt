This year, Nu Skin's Joy in a Bag project is back and we hope to bring joy and smiles to the inpatient children at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, by gifting each one of these little heroes a JOY IN A BAG More put together with love. We want your kind contribution to help us meet the target of bringing joy to OVER 400 CHIILDREN! As one Nu Skin Family, we invite Brand Affiliates to join us in bringing joy to these children today!
