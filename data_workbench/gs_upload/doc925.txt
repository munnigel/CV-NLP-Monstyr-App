NEW IN THE SHOP! ALZ, short for allez, means go in French. In developing the ALZCap and ALZCap SC, Ciele took all the things you love about the Ciele GOCap, increased the COOLwick mesh coverage for more breathability and reduced the size for a lower profile, more fitted look. SC means this Ciele cap comes with a SOFTcurve brim. Pre-curved to shield you from the get go, the SC serves up the same long distance comfort you've become accustomed to, with the performance and protection of a curved brim. Ciele caps are lightweight, reflective, machine washable, packable and very, very stylish. Also, built using REPREVE, the world's number one brand of recycled performance fibre, and backed by Ciele's million miles guarantee. And by working with Fair Trade Certified factories, Ciele supports better working conditions for the people who craft the products we love. Check out the ALZCap SC - Standard Corp Small in the Halo and Indigo styles, the ALZCap SC - Velocity Box in the Mars, Stadium and Shadowcast styles, the ALZCap SC - Athletics Small in the Whitaker, Polaris and October Sky styles, and the ALZCap SC - Century Small in the Melmel style.
