We're always happy to play our part in bringing Singapore's art scene to life! This time, we had the opportunity to support Wei Collective and their brand new work, Being: , that will be showcased in this More year's M1 Fringe Festival from 20 - 22 January. Do check it out! *Photo by Daniel Teo #M1SFF2022 #TheHelpers #FringeFestival #sgArts #sgTheatre #Singapore #sgCultureAnywhere
