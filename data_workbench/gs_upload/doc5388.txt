Fresh colour, familiar look. The Air Jordan 1 Mid "Reverse Bred" brings a whole new take on the classic Jordan 1 colourway. This Air Jordan 1 Mid features a bolder blocking style. The base of the sneaker is in More that classic gym red and covers the majority of the upper. The black acts as an accent colour, covering the toe box, Swoosh logo, the heel counter and ankle flaps. Like all classic Bred colourways, the sneaker has a white midsole with a gym red outsole to finish the look of an old favourite. -------------------------------------------- MEMBERS Online Reservation 22 APRIL -------------------------------------------- Members may place their reservations by logging in to More
