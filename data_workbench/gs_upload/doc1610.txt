This is the moment that some of you have been eagerly waiting for - our Bread of the Month is back! Reigniting the monthly series with Honey & Buckwheat Sourdough (using Multifloral Honey), a partnership that has been baking in the oven with Comvita Singapore for a while now! If you have been following our 10-year journey, you would know that we are 100% up for creating products with simple and natural ingredients. So we immediately hit it off with the folks at Comvita - not because they are founded by fellow kiwis but it's because of their 'hive to table' concept, 100% natural and traceable. Buzz your way to any one of our 12 locations before 31 July to try one for yourself! Enjoy a complimentary 10g sachet of Comvita UMF 5+ Manuka Honey* as an extra condiment for your bread! *Limited sachets are available so you know what to do! - #bakerandcooksg #comvitasg
