Less than 5 days till Easter! If you haven't made any Easter Sunday plans, bring the kiddos and come celebrate with us at Princess Terrace! Not only do children get to eat for free, they'll also get to bring More home their very own Easter Goodie Bag. On top of perennial Peranakan and Penang favourites like kueh pie tee, char kway teow, and Assam laksa, dig into innovative offerings like pork satay with peanut sauce pizza, Hawaiian pizza and fresh fries with cheese.
