On lessons learnt: What's one important lesson you've learnt? @aglimpseofrach: One thing I've come to learn in 2021, is that people are very important. It doesn't matter if you earn less, because ultimately More having people in your life brings you more joy than any money and resources can give. So I always make the effort to spend time with my loved ones and friends no matter how busy I am. Earning a little less or pushing a deadline slightly back is honestly okay. -- Product Featured: Poppin' Quick Slingback Flat Pumps in this season's trending ruched details Launching soon in August #DMKSHOES #journeywithcourage
