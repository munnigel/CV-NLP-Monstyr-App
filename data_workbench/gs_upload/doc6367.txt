. . Vincent Van Gogh is considered one of the most important painters in art history. Inspired by the famous artist, Visconti re-imagined his colors, textures and emotions to create their world famous Van Gogh collection. . Visconti Van Gogh Impressionist Collection, a range of pens inspired by paintings from one of the world's most acclaimed artists. Each Visconti pen is unique and has emerged to represent a specific Van Gogh painting. . Vincent loved nature. Blossoming trees, like in the painting Almond Blossom, were one of his favourite subjects to paint. He painted a number of variations on the theme: ranging from a small flowering sprig in a glass to lavishly blossoming trees. . When van Gogh arrived in Arles in March 1888 fruit trees in the orchards were about to bloom. The blossoms of the apricot, peach and plum trees motivated him, and within a month he had created fourteen paintings of blossoming fruit trees. Excited by the subject matter, van Gogh completed nearly one painting a day. . The painting was a gift for Vincent's newborn nephew. The boy was born on 31 January 1890, and Theo(His Brother) and his wife Jo named him Vincent, after his uncle. Van Gogh was delighted to hear the news. He started work on this painting straight away. He painted the blue sky very precisely around the branches. If you look closely, you can see how many different shades of blue he used, just like in a real-life sky. . : $ . ? ! ! #AestheticBay #EngagingYourSoul #Visconti #Special #Edition #VanGogh #Almond #in #Blossom #Fountain #Pen #Gift #Collectible #IONOrchard #Singapore
