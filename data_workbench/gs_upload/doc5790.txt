Author Session with Norlin Samat Join us for our Read-Aloud Session with the Author of the Ally Series About the Session: Read-along Quizzes Sing-along About the Books Ally's Adventures is a bilingual (English & Malay) book series featuring Ally, a little girl-cat. Set in Singapore, each book follows Ally's adventure at a place that our young readers are familiar with. The series has been created with young readers 0 7 years old in mind and are designed to: encourage early literacy; promote bilingualism; and help develop communications skills. About the author: Norlin Samat is an ex-primary school teacher with a Post-graduate Diploma in Education and an MA in Language Studies. She is a passionate educator with a career spanning more than 18 years as a teacher and an administrator in public and private education institutions. Norlin is a proud to be from a place where being bilingual is the norm. However, as a 'lapsed bilingual' and parent, Norlin understands that helping the little ones pick up a new language can be a challenge. It is not just about the little ones who are starting out; some of us going on the journey with them are also starting again. The Ally's Adventures series is inspired by the learnings from the journey that Norlin is going through with her own child. She hopes the series will help family members and educators in their efforts to raise the next generation of bilinguals.
