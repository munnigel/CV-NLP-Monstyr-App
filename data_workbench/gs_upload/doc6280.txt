We're almost three weeks into the special month of Ramadan. With Hari Raya approaching, it wouldn't make sense for us not to join in the celebrations. This year, Caring Skin is celebrating by raising donations More in support for JAMIYAH SINGAPORE. JAMIYAH SINGAPORE manages a foodbank that distributes food rations such as rice, noodles, cooking oil, canned food etc to those in need with the support of the community. To kickstart our #SayangRaya donation campaign, Caring Skin has pledged $10,000. But we have an ambitious goal of $20,000. This is where you come in. Caring Skin is inviting you to create change in this valuable community with us. HERE'S HOW TO MAKE YOUR CONTRIBUTION More
